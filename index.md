# About Me
Hi, I'm **Alessandro** 👋, a 16-year-old aspiring application developer. I'm currently in a **4-year apprenticeship** :technologe:, with the first year at **ZLI Zürich** 🏫 and the remaining years at **CISTEC**. I'm gaining hands-on experience in software development and learning how to apply my skills in both educational and professional environments.
In my free time, I enjoy going to the **gym** and **gaming** 🎮. I'm passionate about coding, problem-solving, and I'm excited to see how technology shapes the future, especially in the world of finance and innovation! 🚀
